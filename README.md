blog/personal_web/cv

hi! this is my personal website which i decided to make from scratch! i had very little experience before this but i think overall it turned out quite well :)

- doesnt scale properly on mobile devices
- figure out blog and research posts
- white/black theme depending on the device settings? probably will stay dark-ish
- write some actual posts!
- figure how im gonna write the posts? preferably latex
- some visual tweaks and sort of make everything work
- seems laggy ://
