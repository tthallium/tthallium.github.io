hi! this is my personal website which i decided to make from scratch! i had very little experience before this but i think overall it turned out quite well :)

- doesnt scale properly on mobile devices
- i dont like the look of blog posts
- white/black theme depending on the device settings? probably will stay dark-ish
- write some actual posts!
- i dont like copypasting header and footer, there has to be a workaround
    - global header?
    - define function which is just the header
- figure how im gonna write the posts? preferably latex
